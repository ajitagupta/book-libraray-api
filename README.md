The purpose of this bootcamp is to fill all knowledge gaps and take a deep dive into Spring Boot.

As a software engineer, in most projects you work on, Spring and Spring Boot are already implemented and used vigorously. So, you must have used a bit of Spring Boot yourself and extended the API. However, getting to know its essential functionality and setup is crucial in this age of flexible and scalable enterprise projects. Everyone wants it. Everyone needs it. Everyone is switching to this technology. Hence, a bootcamp becomes mandatory to grow in your career and get a good job.

In this bootcamp we build a Book / Library CRUD API from the ground up according to Spring Boot microservice architecture. To this end, we create five Spring Boot projects:
1. Config Client
2. Config Server
3. Feign Consumer
4. RestTemplate Consumer
5. Eureka Server

Each of them depend on each other, and is mandatory to make the applications run. They can be downloaded and should be opened in an IDE like [Spring Tool Suite 4](https://spring.io/tools/). Additionally, we also use Postman for testing *or* consuming our API's, which is [freely available online](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

These projects were created using [Spring Initialzr](https://start.spring.io/).

## 1. Config Client
Spring Boot makes the development of Spring applications faster and easier. Let's analyze our first project *or* microservice (which is simply a small service doing something).

Spring Boot is, like Spring, also based on **Inversion of Control (IoC)**, which is the delegation of creating objects and managing dependencies to a container and the idea behind a framework. It can also make use of annotation-based, setter-based or constructor-based **Dependency Injection (DI)**, where the goal is to create, initialize and wire a Java (or bean) objects defined in application classes and configurations, without the new keyword, and make them available to other components in the application.

Spring Boot uses additional annotations. This includes `RestController` annotation, which marks the class as a Controller, conventional URL's, along with subordinate annotations for HTTP verbs, to make it possible to handle RESTful service requests. Further, Spring uses **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)** to separate individual concerns in different layer packages: one for model, controller, service, respositories, exceptions, and response.

This Spring Boot project `Config Client` is written as a Maven project with general Maven dependencies for JPA, databases, testing and Web (server). Here, you will learn what dependencies are needed. Next, we make the project visible with the server-port defined as `8888` in `application.properties`, as well as `defaultZone` server URL set to `/eureka` under port `8761` and its internal application name set to `client`, and also include the cloud-client and cloud-eureka dependencies. This outsources the code like in the cloud and makes it visible only through a Eureka server. An Eureka server is a centralized registry that knows all client applications running on each port and IP address. Each microservice has to register to it.

Now, let's have a look at some more unwieldy terms to support our API, which simply contains **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations** for the Book and Library class.


### Service
A Spring boot service is defined as a class file that includes the `@Service` annotation and allows developers to add business functionalities *or* business *logic*. The annotation is used with the classes that provide these business functionalities.

### Controller
The Spring boot framework is used to make the enterprise application which can be based on Groovy, Java, and Kotlin. By the use of this, we can make a web application; in order to have communication between the front and the backend, we require controllers in our applications; these controllers are responsible for handling the request from the client and providing them with the response in return.

The `@RestController` annotation is mainly used to mark the controller as a basic API endpoint used to access a service. This is what we call a REST API.

### Model
Model is an essential part of **MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern** which is widely used in Spring. A Model is a holder of the context data (obtained from the database) passed by a Controller to be displayed on a View.
### View
All MVC frameworks for web applications provide a way to address views. Spring provides view resolvers, which enable you to render models in a browser without tying you to a specific view technology. All controllers in the Spring Web MVC framework return a `ModelAndView` instance. Views in Spring are addressed by a view name and are resolved by a view resolver. 

### Repository
Now that we have our model designed, we can create our JPA repositories so we can store and read our Java objects. Following our packaging structure and the layered application pattern, we'll create repositories in a new repository
package.

For each of the model entities in the application, we define a repository interface. The repository `JPARepository` includes all the methods such as sorting, paginating data and CRUD operations, making it a very convenient solution. One can thus implement this interface with an underlying interface. For specifying that the underlying interface is a repository, a marker annotation `@Repository` is used.

### Microservice three-tier approach, layering
We have learnt to write a well-designed, layered Spring Boot application where we used a three-tier approach: model, application, presentation, and data. This is a well-known pattern for its benefits related to loose coupling and clear separation of responsibilities. But there is still much more to learn: once you get several of these applications, how are they going to connect to each other? How do they see each otherâ€™s instances if they start
to scale up? It's time to move to microservices.
