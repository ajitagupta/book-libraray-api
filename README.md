The purpose of this bootcamp is to fill all knowledge gaps and take a deep dive into Spring Boot. In most projects you encounter Spring and Spring Boot are already implemented. So, syu must've have used a bit of Spring Boot, but getting to know more of its functionality is crucial in this age of scalable enterprise projects. For this bootcamp we create four Spring projects:
1. Config Client
2. Config Server
3. Feign Consumer
4. RestTemplate Consumer
5. Eureka Server

Each of them is mandatory to understand everything. Each of them can be downloaded and should be opened in an IDE like [Spring Tool Suite 4](https://spring.io/tools/). Additionally, we also use Postman for testing our API's, which is [freely available online](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).
