The purpose of this bootcamp is to fill all knowledge gaps and take a deep dive into Spring Boot. In most projects you encounter Spring and Spring Boot are already implemented. So, you must've have used a bit of Spring Boot and extended the API, but getting to know its full functionality is crucial in this age of scalable enterprise projects. For this bootcamp we create five Spring Boot projects:
1. Config Client
2. Config Server
3. Feign Consumer
4. RestTemplate Consumer
5. Eureka Server

Each of them interplay and depend on each other, and is mandatory to understand everything. They can be downloaded and should be opened in an IDE like [Spring Tool Suite 4](https://spring.io/tools/). Additionally, we also use Postman for testing our API's, which is [freely available online](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).
